# Contact Form Application

This is a simple and elegant Contact Form application built with React, TypeScript, and Vite. The application features a form with full name, email, and message fields, along with validation, fancy UI elements, and animations.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The UI is fully responsive and works well on all screen sizes.
- **Form Validation**: Client-side validation is implemented using `react-hook-form` to ensure all fields are correctly filled out.
- **Smooth Animations**: The form elements feature smooth animations for an enhanced user experience.
- **Customizable**: Easily customizable CSS with modular stylesheets for each component.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: A superset of JavaScript that adds static types.
- **Vite**: A fast build tool that serves as an alternative to create-react-app.
- **CSS**: For styling the application, including animations and responsive design.
